The day begins with a survey of familiar platforms—desktop and mobile—to uncover the new solutions that are replacing yesterday’s best practices. From there, we’ll move into newer design tools—speech, bots, physical interfaces, artificial intelligence, and more—to see how these fresh-from-the-future technologies fit into your everyday products and processes.

You’ll learn the tools and techniques for prototyping and launching these new interfaces, but you’ll also learn the answers to foundational questions for all your projects:
