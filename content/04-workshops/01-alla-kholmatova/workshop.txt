Title: Reaching For Particles On The Web: Modular Design Workshop

----

Trainer: Alla Kholmatova

----

Intro: 

**Full-day workshop &bullet; September 13th**
We've all been there: once a shiny, new, thoroughly crafted website becomes outdated, inconsistent, bloated and expensive to maintain.

We often talk about atoms, molecules and templates, yet how can we make sense of all of those fancy particles in our day-to-day work? In her new workshop, Alla Kholmatova, the interaction designer behind the open education platform FutureLearn, explores how we can **design and build responsive interfaces that would stand the test of time**.

More: 

Can we continue scaling the platform, without losing its original essence and making it feel like it’s been patched together? Can we keep our code clean, flexible and future-proof long-term? Can we be prepared for any new requirements — however unpredictable they might be (adapting a website for VR, for example?). Yes, we can — by **moving away from designing pages towards designing systems**.

### What you'll learn:
- How to establish a modular system using **atomic design**,
- How to adapt atomic design to suit your team’s needs,
- How to define and evolve **design patterns**,
- How to establish a **shared design language** within your team,
- How to validate and **test patterns and modules**,
- How to combine the patterns together in a way that doesn’t break the whole,
- How to organize designs and structure code in a modular fashion,
- How to **create a living pattern library**,
- How to make sure your design system can cope with new requirements,
- How to establish a **"modular" thinking culture** in mid-size to large teams.

You'll also take away a few common stumbling blocks, a few lessons learned and a plethora of practical, hands-on tips on establishing a pattern language within your company.

We won’t be touching too much on code; instead, the workshop will focus on design techniques and practical ways of creating a **scalable, flexible and modular design system** — applicable to both small and large web projects.

### Who is it for?
The workshop is intended for visual, interaction and UX designers as well as front-end developers who are still seeking for just the right responsive design process and deliverables.

### What hardware/software do you need?
A laptop with Sketch/Photoshop/Text editor or another design tool of your choice. Come well rested and enthusiastic with your favorite stationary at hand.
