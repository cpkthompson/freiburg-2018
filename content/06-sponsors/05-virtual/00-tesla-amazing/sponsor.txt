Title: Tesla Amazing

----

Text: Tesla Amazing is a fast-growing international team that debuted on Kickstarter in March 2015 with Magnetic - a modern twist on sticky notes, whiteboards, and other stationery that makes paper as sleek as it should be in the 21st century. Itâ€™s based on a unique technology which provides double-sided, full-coverage stick to almost any smooth surface. Rather than using glue to adhere, Magnetic clings using a stable static charge.
