Bio:

Ian leads the front end infrastructure team at BuzzFeed working on performance, testing, automation and resilience. He is particularly fond of working on problems relating to scale: both of sites and of teams.

His background is in Front End Web Development and it’s only in recent years that he has stepped away from feature development to focus on Front End Infrastructure. He is a big fan of continuous delivery and creating a safe environment to push code quickly and easily. Prior to BuzzFeed he worked for Schibsted Media, Lonely Planet and Burberry.
