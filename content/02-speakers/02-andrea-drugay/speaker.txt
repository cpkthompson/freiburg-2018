Talk: Ethics in UX Writing

----

Description: 

Whether or not you have a UX writer on your team, you interact with UX copy every day. UX writers are the ones who put the copy in your products, from microcopy to onboarding flows. We agonize over granular details and word choices. But it’s not just about whether an error message sounds all right, or if there’s a way to create delight in empty state copy.

Dark patterns and user privacy are major concerns in web design, while trickery abounds, from confirmshaming to misleading user flows and accessibility issues. Writers and designers have a responsibility to provide their users with transparency and a smooth experience.

In this talk, Andrea will be sharing personal experiences that highlight struggles and solutions to ethics in UX writing. You’ll learn to recognize, revise, and resolve dark patterns and misleading copy in your own products. She’ll share top tips and best practices, so you and your writers and designers can recognize, revise, and resolve on your own.
