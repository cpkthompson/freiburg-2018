Talk: A Word to the Wise: Writing product copy to transform your user experience

----

Description: 

Getting the right words into your product is a process that’s akin to designing with words. Great UX writing isn't a fill-in-the-blanks approach, but a strategy and creative process, just like design and product development. 

In this talk, Andrea will be sharing top tips and best practices for making sure your product copy is clear, concise, and consistent. You’ll learn to avoid misleading or confusing wording, write error messages that don’t frustrate your users, and even create delight where and when possible. She'll also share tips on process, organization, and flow, so your design team can create copy that helps your users have the best possible experience. You’ll come away from the talk with ideas and inspiration to create and manage all the copy in your products, from microcopy to onboarding flows.
