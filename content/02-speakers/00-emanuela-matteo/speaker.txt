Talk: Redesign Design

----

Description:

Over the next years, how we design, prototype, and test services and products will change dramatically. We are transitioning from a traditional, industrial mindset of design as a rigid planning process towards the experience of design as a continuous and evolving conversation between makers and users. This talk, based on real-life experiences, explores how design is changing in the digital age, beyond the initial delivery of specifications and blueprints, to an adaptive co-creation process that evolves iteratively over time. This emergent idea of designOps is dissolving the boundaries between planning, discovery, building, and operating phases, leading to results that are more in tune with the true needs of users.
