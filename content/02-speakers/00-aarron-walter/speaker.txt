Want to make great products? You'll have to build a great team first. Great teams are comprised of people with complimentary skills, but more importantly, complimentary personalities.

After nearly a decade of leading design teams at MailChimp, Aarron Walter has wisdom to share that will help you navigate these murky waters. In this talk, Aarron tackles the skill seeking, personality sussing, and crystal ball gazing that are part and parcel of building a killer design team.
