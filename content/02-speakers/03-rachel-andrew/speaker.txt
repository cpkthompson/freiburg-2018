Talk: Laying Out The Future With Grid And Flexbox

----

Description: 

CSS is now over 20 years old, yet it has taken this long for us to get a true layout system designed for web pages and applications. A layout system, not based on hacking properties designed for something else entirely, but one that considers the reality of design for the web today.

With CSS Grid Layout landing in browsers, it is time to get to grips with this new layout system and discover how CSS Grid Layout works alongside Flexbox and the Box Alignment module to bring real layout to the web for the first time. In this talk you’ll learn the basics of Grid Layout and how it fits with existing layout methods such as Flexbox. You’ll also discover how these new standards get into browsers and how CSS itself has evolved to give you a way to support older browsers while taking advantage of these new specifications.
