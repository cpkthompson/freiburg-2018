Talk: Teams, Cultures, And Design System Strategies

----

Description:

Every design system is unique. Your organisational structure, team culture, design approach, project, and even the physical space you’re in, will shape your system. In this talk I invite you to think beyond patterns and components, and look at the underlying structures and connections which make your design system what it is.
