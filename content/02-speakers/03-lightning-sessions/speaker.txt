### Educational Technologies - Design and Usability Challenges
####Tanja Adam

A teacher's perspective: teachers are encouraged to use modern technologies for their teaching. What tools can I use in order to combine pedagogical needs and design at the same time? Open source learning management platforms such as Moodle are the industry standard. They have a huge potential. 

Design matters if we want students to be engaged with educational technologies. What if I cannot code? Where can I find tools and plugins that help me re-design to meet my didactical claims? We need to face it, teaching and studying needs good and modern design and engaging colors to be successful!

####Sjoerd Valk - [@sjoerdus](https://www.twitter.com/sjoerdus) 

Websites and applications are becoming more and more based on datastreams and asynchronous behaviour. Frameworks and best practices are moving to a reactive way of handling these data-streams. Understanding data-streams can be hard, to test them can even harder. With marble-diagrams we can understand and test our data-streams and observables.

### Canvas Your Life
####Nicolas Gehlert - [@gehlertn](https://www.twitter.com/gehlertn) 

In HTML5 the `<canvas>` Element was introduced and it can draw and manipulate graphics via JavaScript.
For a lot of people it is just something libraries use under the hood but it is actually pretty easy to have some fun with it. 
So in this talk I will give a couple of examples how to get started with canvas and how I rebuild one of my favorite childhood DOS games with it.
