Talk: Designing for kids is not a game

----

Description: 

The children of today are growing up in a different paradigm than their parents, who might even remember what the world was like before the Internet! 
This impacts the way they perceive and interact with the world around them, especially with digital products. 
In this talk, Trine will explain how kids develop and learn, and how to design digital products that help them grow rather than dumb them down.
