Talk: Designing For Global Audiences

----

Description: 

Going global is often in most companies’ current or future business development plans. Even if your products do not have a presence yet outside your home market, they are no doubt being used by audiences from different parts of the world. Design and build a product with a global audience in mind is important.

Even big companies do not always get it right. It is not because they do not have a good product or the right operation setup, but it often boils down to one thing: They do not properly understand the ecosystem of the market, what local audiences really want and need, the experience they are after, and most importantly what influencing and driving those behaviours and needs.
