Description:

The sane version of my talk title would be 'Modern Web Security Standards' but I wanted to make light of the fact that sometimes there can be too many to keep up with.

In this talk I'm going to introduce you to some awesome features that allow us to quickly and easily boost security and offer better protection to our visitors. From mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to enforcing the use of HTTPS or protecting ourselves against rogue Certificate Authorities and Content Delivery Networks, these are just some of the things that are possible.

If you were to implement even one of the standards I'm going to talk about today, you'd probably be doing better than your bank!
