Talk: Atoms, Modules And Other Fancy Particles

----

Description:

As many of us move away from designing pages toward designing systems, one concept keeps coming up: modularity. Modular systems promise to be scalable, maintainable, and easier to work with – but what if the “system” we end up with doesn’t perform as well as we expect? What if the result is disappointing – an overly simplistic “patched together” design, that’s not nearly as scalable and adaptable as we’d hoped?

In this talk we’ll look at what it actually means to have a resistant design system and a shared pattern language in your team. We’ll talk through the steps to get there, as well as mistakes, stumbling blocks, and lessons learnt.
