Bio: 

Alma Hoffmann is a quirky and funky design educator who motivates and pushes her students to be the best they can be. She is not a stranger to explore unconventional teaching methodsâ€”such as laying on the floor, if needed, to look at something from another point of view, or making students look at things upside down. Her curiosity drives her to explore and continue learning. She is also the Design editor at Smashing since many years. Her curiosity drives her to explore and continue learning. And she loves ice cream, chocolate chip from Baskin Robbins, if you are wondering.
