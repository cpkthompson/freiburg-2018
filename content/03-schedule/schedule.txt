Intro:

Below you'll find the schedule for our 6th SmashingConf Freiburg. Please note that we changed the timings and the number of breaks. Also, we’ll start slightly later than in the previous years (at 9:30), plus we have an evening session at our party at the ‘Historisches Kaufhaus’ We hope you’ll enjoy the new format!
