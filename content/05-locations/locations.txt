<h2>Historical Merchants’ Hall</h2>

The “Historisches Kaufhaus” (Historic Merchants’ Hall, built 1520-30) is the venue for the **conference and the workshops** from Sept. 10th throughout Sept. 12th.

It is a symbol of the importance of trade in medieval Freiburg. The municipal market, customs and financial administration building is identified as a center of trade by its arcades hall. Its façade is decorated with coats of arms and statues indicating the city’s links with the House of Habsburg.

The beautiful ambience of the Historical Merchants’ Hall underlines our goal to create something special for you.
