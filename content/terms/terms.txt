## Refunds

If you have to cancel your workshop and/or conference ticket(s), please send us an email at <em>hello [at] smashingconf.com</em> at latest <strong>two weeks before the event</strong>. Once you cancel the ticket(s), you will receive a refund of your reservation but please keep in mind that we have to plan tickets way ahead of time, so we'll request a 15% cancellation fee. Cancellations made later than two weeks before the event starts and attendees who fail to attend for some reason, can't be considered for refunds. Sorry.

****

## Transferring your ticket

If you'd like to transfer your ticket to a friend or colleague without the reservation being refunded, that's no problem at all — no cancellation fees will occur. Don't forget to send us the new attendee contact details at <em>hello [at] smashingconf.com</em> no later than two days before the event you are registered for. We'll sort it out quickly.

****

## Cancellation

If an event is cancelled, Smashing Events GmbH will fully refund your registration fee with no penalties or other reductions — no questions asked! However, we can't cover travel or hotel reservation costs. Sorry! 

****

## Prices

All prices mentioned on this website include the local sales tax where the event takes place (if applicable), and any other transaction fees.

****

## Accessibility

Please send us a short email at <em>hello [at] smashingconf.com</em> if you want to attend at workshops or the conference and have any special requirements such as access for wheelchairs. We will do our very best to accommodate you. No worries — we are prepared for pretty much everything!

## Photos, videos and quotes

We'll be taking photos and videos of the talks to use online or in our printed materials. Since you'll be attending the event, eventually you might end up on one of the photos. We'd love to reserve the rights to make such photos and videos and to use your feedback — with the contributor being fully credited whenever possible.Please understand that lengthy video and sound recordings of sessions and workshops might be annoying and disruptive at the event. So please kindly ask for our permission first if you are planning to make photos or record videos.
