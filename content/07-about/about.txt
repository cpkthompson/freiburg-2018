Intro:

It's that time of the year again! We are happy to present the sixth annual edition of **Smashing Conference Freiburg** — a _friendly, valuable and inspiring community event_ that will help us all, web designers and developers, to become better at what we do.

The main focus of the conference is an insight into how we, as designers, solve real-life design problems and what workflow we are using to solve them intelligently. Two full days with practical talks on smart  techniques, clever strategies and useful tools.

Please spread the word about it on Twitter, Facebook, your blog and anywhere you can. And to make this as easy as possible, we have produced some assets. Please let us know if anything is missing. And thanks a lot for your help!

## Why the Smashing Conference?

<div class="columns" markdown="1">
Since 2006, (link: http://www.smashingmagazine.com text: Smashing Magazine) has delivered useful and innovative information to web designers and developers around the world. The design community is full of talented and hard-working folks who come up with brilliant ideas every day. Smashing Magazine provides a platform to share and discuss the work and knowledge of the best designers and developers out there, chase down the latest developments in the industry and stay on top of new techniques, methods, workflows and tricks.

The conference moves beyond online communication and aims to bring web designers and developers closer together. We want to provide an **inspiring, forward-thinking event** where you can connect and network with others on a personal level in a stunning yet friendly environment.

We aim to deliver the same high-quality content that Smashing Magazine delivers, while adding a personal element to create an experience that brings great value to everyone involved. We want you to share how you work, design, code and build the web today.
